And the story of Ashray, who had a rocky start in life. With hard work and determination, he translates his dreams into reality, but his deep-seated insecurities come to the fore when life throws him a curveball.
As their stories intersect, their lives change in ways they never expected.
In a world of loss, darkness and destruction, will Jhanvi and Ashray be able to tell a story of hope, light and recovery?
