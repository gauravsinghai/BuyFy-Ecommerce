Few people know better than Viswanathan Anand how to tackle the gravest obstacles and overcome the toughest odds.

From the time he learnt to move pieces on a chess board as a six-year-old, Vishy - as Anand is fondly known - has racked up innumerable accolades. The first World Chess Champion from Asia, he emerged onto the world stage when chess was largely a Soviet preserve, climbed the ranks to become world No. 1, bagged five world championship titles and won tournaments across all formats of the game. An ambassador of the sport like no other, his is one of the most revered names in chess.
