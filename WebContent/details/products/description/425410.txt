Concepts of Physics explains the different theories and concepts in an easy-to-understand way, making it popular among students. H. C. Verma s book is an all-inclusive theoretical and conceptual guide that covers a vast range of topics. It is an ideal book not only for pre-college students but also for those appearing for competitive exams in the field of engineering and medicine. It is a book that aims to comprehensively guide the students in various aspects of physics thus, making them fully equipped to answer any type of questions that may come in the exams. Volume 2 of the Concepts of Physics starts with a chapter on Heat and Temperature. It moves on to explain the Kinetic Theory of Gases. The concepts of Calorimetry, Law of Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, Specific Heat Capacities of Gases are discussed in the subsequent chapters. There are separate chapters on Gauss s Law, Electric Field and Potential, and Capacitors. The book also features chapters and detailed explanations on Electric Current in Conductors, Thermal and Chemical effects of Electric Current, and Magnetic Field.
