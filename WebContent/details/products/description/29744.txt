Seven lectures by the brilliant theoretical physicist have been compiled into this book to try to explain to the common man, the complex problems of mathematics and the question that has been gripped everyone all for centuries, the theory of existence.

Undeniably intelligent, witty and childlike in his explanations, the narrator describes every detail about the beginning of the universe. He describes what a theory that can state the initiation of everything would encompass.

Ideologies about the universe by Aristotle, Augustine, Hubble, Newton and Einstein have all been briefly introduced to the reader. Black holes and Big Bang has been explained in an unsophisticated manner for anyone to understand.

All these events and individual theories may be strung together to create a theory of the origin of everything and the author strongly believes that the origin might not necessarily be from a singular event. He advocates the idea of a multi-dimensional origin with a no-boundary condition to remain true to the theories of modern physics and quantum physics.
